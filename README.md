# hello-world
First github repository.

Cory here, setting up github in order to start a summer project to begin my programming portfolio. I plan to hopefully and effectively learn Python3 and create an application and UI on my RasperryPi 2. 

I am a student at the University of West Florida and am majoring in Cybersecurity and would like to follow the ambition of either working within cyber security or designing software for a company.
